A tick is sometimes rendered outside of the user-defined `max` axis limit when `includeBounds=false`
### Expected behavior

When `includeBounds` on the axis of a line chart is set to `false` and `min` and `max` of the axis are defined, there shouldn't be any ticks outside of the defined axis limits.

### Current behavior

In some cases, a tick is created outside of the user-defined `max` axis limit. This especially happens with small axis limits (in my code sample: `min: 2.404e-8, max: 2.4141e-8`).

### Possible solution

Please see my proposed fix: https://github.com/CodingMarco/Chart.js/commit/1f1fd7971b4c05efb11fa3127ce1f2ea088c72bb.
This commit would fix the issue, however I'm looking for feedback if this is the correct way of fixing it.
Maybe another option would be to fix the calculation of numSpaces, but I think the advantage of my proposed fix is that it works in all edge cases.

All currently existing tests run successfully with my fix.

### Context

When plotting eye diagrams commonly used to characterize digital signals, it looks very ugly if there is space next to the eye diagram (without the fix, see left image). With my proposed fix, it looks much better (see right image).
