loadStrings() omits empty lines
v0.6.1

when loading a file containing empty lines, *processing* includes empty strings in the array for each empty line.

p5.js filters out empty lines.

here's a demo: https://codepen.io/Spongman/pen/wXVeYP
this loads and prints lines 24 onwards from the p5.js library, here: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.6.1/addons/p5.dom.js

the text file looks like this:
```
 * @main
 */

(function(root, factory) {
  if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd)
    define('p5.dom', ['p5'], function(p5) {
      factory(p5);
    });
```

but the string array returned by `loadStrings` omits the empty lines:

i discovered this trying to work out why the line numbers for errors in glsl shaders loaded by `loadShader` don't match up with the lines in the source files. this bug makes it particularly frustrating trying to track down such errors.
