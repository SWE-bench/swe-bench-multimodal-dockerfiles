Signup: Include OAuth client ID when switching from the signup to login form


If, during the sign up flow of an OAuth/WPCC Client, the user switches from login form to signup form and back again, then reloads the page, the client ID is lost causing styling to be lost.

#### Steps to reproduce
1. Start at a WPCC login page, for example, https://wordpress.com/log-in?client_id=50916&redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic-api.wordpress.com%2Foauth2%2Fauthorize%3Fresponse_type%3Dcode%26client_id%3D50916%26state%3D3073eba04c6018e59238c17d39565c35%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwoocommerce.com%252Fwc-api%252Fwpcom-signin%253Fnext%253Dmy-dashboard%26blog_id%3D0%26wpcom_connect%3D1
2. Click on the 'Create an account' link 
3. On the resulting sign up screen, click on the 'Already have a WordPress.com account? Log in now.' link.
4. Once loaded, reload the login page.

#### What I expected
To be presented with the same styled login page.

#### What happened instead
I'm shown the standard WordPress.com login page.

#### Browser / OS version
This isn't browser/OS specific, but I've tested this with Mac OS Sierra and both Chrome 63 and Firefox 58.

#### Screenshot / Video
See above for screenshots

#### Context / Source
I found this while developing the login/signup screens for Jetpack.com. I thought it was something that I had introduced, but managed to confirm that it affected other sites like Woocommerce.

Not an earth shattering bug, but I thought I'd report and fix it anyway!
