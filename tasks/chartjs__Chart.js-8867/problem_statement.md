[FEATURE] Allow Axis ticks to render inside chart bounds e.g. `ticksInside`
My request is relevant to line charts. I wonder if there could be an option to render ticks inside the chart area?

Here's an xAxis example of how things layout without the xAxis shown:

As you can see, when I hide the xAxis scales the chart displays full-width perfectly, edge to edge.

However, when I enable the xAxis I get padding left and right of the chart to facilitate the tick label sitting centrally with the first and last data point:

# Request
Would you consider adding an option that spaces the tick labels inside the chart bounds? To illustrate, the feature would allow a layout like this with ticks in either Axis rendered within the chart bounds:
