"""Mirror the binary assets a task's tests need.

Some tasks compare rendering against a baseline image, which a text patch cannot
carry. The dataset lists those files under ``image_assets`` as {path, url} pairs,
and the harness stages them into the container after applying the patch.

Keeping a copy with the task means an evaluation does not depend on a url still
being reachable years later. Assets live at ``tasks/<instance_id>/assets/<path>``,
mirroring where they land in the repository under test.

The images a problem statement links to are mirrored too, at
``tasks/<instance_id>/problem_assets/<n>-<name>``, where ``n`` is the entry's
position in ``image_assets.problem_statement``. They are the pictures a model is
shown, and the Dockerfile COPYs them into the image, so a rotted url cannot make
one go missing. The index prefix keeps them ordered and distinct, since 19
instances link to different images that share a filename.

    python -m dockerfile_gen.assets                 # fetch whatever is missing
    python -m dockerfile_gen.assets --force         # re-download everything
    python -m dockerfile_gen.assets -i <instance_id>
