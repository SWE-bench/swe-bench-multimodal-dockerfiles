Activity Log: app banner related to Stats is shown
Visit https://wordpress.com/stats/activity/YOURSITESLUG in a mobile device. I was actually able to find this in Chrome's mobile emulator in dev tools:

<img width="336" alt="captura de pantalla 2018-03-22 a la s 10 34 26" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1041600/37774589-66c5670e-2dbf-11e8-8248-9d61ac3a6358.png">

Right now we have nothing in the Redux state that allows us to discriminate this based on `/activity`.

As can be seen in https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/client/blocks/app-banner/index.jsx#L149 it only looks at `/stats` and this is why this banner is showing.

We should have more information about the path being visited so we can exclude it in AL.
