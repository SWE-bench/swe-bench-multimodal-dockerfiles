Jetpack Connect: Plans page inadvertently shows site entry screen for subscribers
It seems that when a non-admin user attempts to connect their site, initiating the flow in Jetpack, after connection, they're directed to `/jetpack/connect/plans`, but they see the JPC initial site entry screen instead of the plans page.

#### Steps to reproduce
* Connect a Jetpack site with your Jetpack site admin user.
* Login in WP.com with another user.
* Create a non-admin (subscriber) user with the same email that you use for the .com account in the last step.
* Login to your Jetpack site with the new subscriber user.
* Connect the site for the subscriber user, starting from wp-admin.
* Approve the connection in the JPC flow.
* Witness a short redirect loop in the URL bar.
* You're presented with the JPC initial site entry step, rather than the plans page (but the URL is `/jetpack/connect/plans`).

#### What I expected
To be redirected back to wp-admin.

#### What happened instead
I was presented with the JPC plans page URL, but it displayed the JPC initial site entry step.
