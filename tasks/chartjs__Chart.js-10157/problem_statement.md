borderRadius gets ignored for the bottom corners of 0-value bars in bar chart when borderSkipped and minBarLength are set
## Expected Behavior
When setting the following properties on a dataset:
```js
minBarLength: 50,
borderRadius: 100,
borderSkipped: false,
```
bars with a value of 0 should show up as a circle with all corners respecting the `borderRadius` setting

## Current Behavior
bars with a value of 0 are showing up instead with the bottom two corners ignoring the `borderRadius` setting and rendering as semi-circles with flat bottoms, like this:

## Steps to Reproduce
Example: https://codepen.io/dcj/pen/VwMbGZM

## Context
Trying to respect the designed version of the chart, where the value of some bars will be 0, and want to render those in a consistent way that respects the design

## Environment
* Chart.js version: latest
* Browser name and version: happens the same in latest version of Safari, Chrome, Brave, Firefox
* Link to your project: [I can add a GitHub link to a PR where this will live, but it's not clean enough to push up yet]
